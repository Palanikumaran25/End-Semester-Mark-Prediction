# End-Semester-Mark-Prediction
1. This machine learning model app is End Semester Mark Prediction.
2. Predict students' end-semester marks using machine learning techniques based on internal scores, attendance, and other academic features.

3. ðŸ§  Model Used:
âœ… Linear Regression (from sklearn.linear_model)
   Linear regression is chosen due to its:
   Simplicity and interpretability.
   Low variance and computational efficiency.
   Good baseline performance.

4. ðŸ“Š Workflow:
Data Cleaning â€“ handle missing values if any.
Feature Engineering â€“ select relevant input features.
Train-Test Split â€“ 80/20 split for training and testing.
Model Training â€“ apply LinearRegression() model.
Prediction â€“ predict marks for test data.
Evaluation â€“ using RÂ² score, MAE, RMSE.
